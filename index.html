	<h1>Hi there, I'm Ayo Akinmade!</h1>
	<p> I’m currently a senior at Rice University, studying Computer Science. 
		I am interested in most fields of Computer Science, but I have industry experience in backend-engineering and web development. 
		I’m always trying to learn and apply new technologies.In my spare time, I like to read, play soccer and eat Takis. Sometimes all three at the same time. </p>
