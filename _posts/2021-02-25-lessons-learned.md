Well. Finally got around to building a personal website. I have a feeling that i went down the wrong path and ended up making a website for a decade ago, rather than today. I didn't have a clear plan on what I wanted to build or the technologies/web development framework that I wanted to learn about. 

I think this is my first lesson: Have a clear objective in mind. While this page covers the core use cases of a personal website e.g. introduce the individual and share contact information, it does not utilize on any modern web development technologies/framweworks. This implementation seems awkward and better suited to a blog-style type of personal page where the author posts frequently. This was NOT my intention.  

Second, I needed to investigate more sources that provide both  information and choice.

Lastly, I'm happy that I got something of a draft reasonably working. It was an opportunity to put random pieces of frontend knowledge to a practical use so it was built on a whim and heavy basis on this example:
