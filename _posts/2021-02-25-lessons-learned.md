Well. Finally got around to building a personal website. But I have a feeling that I went down the wrong path. The current barebones static HTML+CSS stack has more in common with websites designed with the standard technologies of a decade ago, rather than today. This is mostly because I didn't have a clear plan on what I wanted to build or the technologies/web development framework that I wanted to use/learn about. 

The first lesson is to have a clear objective in mind. While this page clearly covers the core use cases of a personal website e.g. introduce the individual and share contact information, it is not extensible. If I wanted to create a new blog format, I'd need to create a new layout (see _layouts/), commit the new content from a local .md file and wait for a while (1-2 mins) for GitHub to render it. This is a lot of hassle. Also, this method is not modular. There seems to be no equivalent of function in HTML/CSS so code is not reusable.  Growing the page in this manner is bad for testing and design. Finally, it does not utilize on any modern web development technologies/framweworks which was an unstated goal, a of unclear goals. So I will need to state a clear goal for my next project.

A second lesson is to investigate more sources to understand the trade-offs between available choices.  

Lastly, I'm happy that I got something of a draft working well. It was an opportunity to put random pieces of frontend knowledge to practical use. It was built on a late-night, takis-fueled whim and HERE basis on this example [here](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). Please check it out.
