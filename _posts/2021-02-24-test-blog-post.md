Well. Finally got around to making a personal website. I have a nagging feeling that i've gone down the wrong path because I wanted to build something that was modern with the words java/typescript, react js framework and not html/css. I think this is my first lesson. I need to do a bit of research instead of just jumping into the first example available. This has been quite fun tho learning about html/css in the meantime.
