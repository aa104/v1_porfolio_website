Well. Finally got around to making a personal website. I have a nagging feeling that i've gone down the wrong path because I wanted to build something that was modern i.e. saying I used and understood a key component, tool or technology of the modern web development framework. Being able to say I used {java/type}script and react js or angular frameworks. I think this is my first lesson. I need to do a bit more research before jumping into the first tutorial with a clear example. Coding in HTML feels like driving with brick wheels.
